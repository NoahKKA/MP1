my first milestone project.

Quick Summary.
This is a basic platform jumping game I call Squishy Jump.  It uses basic javascript syntax and methods to create, move, and change platforms and character movments.  Also, it includes some css for styling.  I created the player sprites using url - https://www.piskelapp.com/ and implemented them in my assets folder.  The whole game runs ontop a canvas element in html hence why the html file is not impressive.  The game keeps previous scores in an array to generate a High Score.  The data is not kept in the browser's localStorage.  

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Game RULES :

Press space bar to jump.
Move side to side using 'A' and 'D'
Score is incremented by one each time the player lands on a platform. (You cannot keep incrementing your score on the same platform)
The platforms will move faster each time the score increments by 5.


Enjoy the game and have fun :D

In the future I would love to add more character sprites and add character customization.  
Make it less laggy whilst running it for a long period of time. 
Add a currency system where you could purchase new color of character sprites and customization for character.
Utilize the browser's local storage to keep track of score and everything else.

These games are what influenced me to create a platform game.  While not the exact replica of Doodle Jump or JumpKing, it has some of the same features as these games.
